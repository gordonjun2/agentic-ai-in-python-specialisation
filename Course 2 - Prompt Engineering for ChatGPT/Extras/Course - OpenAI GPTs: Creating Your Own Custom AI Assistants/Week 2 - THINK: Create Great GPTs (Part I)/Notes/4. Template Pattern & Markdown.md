# Template Pattern & Markdown

When responding to users, GPTs often use markdown to format the text in a structured and visually appealing way. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows for easy formatting of text, including headers, lists, links, and more. If you'd like to learn more about markdown and how to use it, I'd recommend checking out the Markdown Guide at

When using the Template Pattern, you can define the formatting of your desired output using markdown.

Format of the Template Pattern

To use this pattern, your prompt should make the following fundamental contextual statements:

I am going to provide a template for your output or I want you to produce your output using this template

X or \<X\> is my placeholder for content (optional)

Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list (optional)

Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide (optional)

This is the template: PATTERN with PLACEHOLDERS

You will need to replace "X" with an appropriate placeholder, such as "CAPITALIZED WORDS" or "\<PLACEHOLDER\>". You will then need to specify a pattern to fill in, such as "Dear \<FULL NAME\>" or "NAME, TITLE, COMPANY".

Examples:

Create a random strength workout for me today with complementary exercises. I am going to provide a template for your output . CAPITALIZED WORDS are my placeholders for content. Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide. This is the template: NAME, REPS @ SETS, MUSCLE GROUPS WORKED, DIFFICULTY SCALE 1-5, FORM NOTES

Please create a grocery list for me to cook macaroni and cheese from scratch, garlic bread, and marinara sauce from scratch. I am going to provide a template for your output . \<placeholder\> are my placeholders for content. Try to fit the output into one or more of the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the formatting and overall template that I provide. This is the template: Aisle \<name of aisle\>: \<item needed from aisle\>, \<qty\> \(\<dish(es) used in\>\)
