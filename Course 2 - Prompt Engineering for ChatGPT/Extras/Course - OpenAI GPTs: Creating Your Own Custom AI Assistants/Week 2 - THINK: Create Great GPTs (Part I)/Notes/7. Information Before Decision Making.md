# Information Before Decision Making

When designing a custom GPT model to solve a problem for a user, it's essential to consider various types of information to enhance its effectiveness. Here's a rough categorization of 5â€“6 types of information:

1. **Problem Context**: Understanding the context in which the problem arises is crucial. What is the specific issue or challenge the user is facing? Providing background information about the problem helps the model generate more relevant responses.

2. **User Preferences**: Knowing the user's preferences can significantly improve the quality of the solution. This includes preferences related to language style, tone, level of formality, and specific requirements or constraints they might have.

3. **Domain Knowledge**: Depending on the problem domain, incorporating relevant domain-specific knowledge is vital. Whether it's about technology, medicine, finance, or any other field, having a grasp of the relevant concepts and terminologies enables the model to generate accurate and insightful responses.

4. **Past Interactions**: Considering the user's past interactions with the system can provide valuable insights. This includes analyzing previous queries, feedback, and outcomes to tailor responses more effectively and avoid repeating information.

5. **Current Context**: Understanding the current state of affairs or the environment in which the problem exists is essential. This could involve factors such as time, location, events, and any other relevant contextual information that influences the problem or its solution.

6. **Desired Outcome**: Knowing the desired outcome or goal the user wants to achieve helps the model generate solutions that are aligned with their objectives. Understanding what success looks like for the user enables the model to provide more targeted and actionable recommendations.

Considering these types of information can help customize a GPT model to better address the user's needs and solve their problems effectively.
