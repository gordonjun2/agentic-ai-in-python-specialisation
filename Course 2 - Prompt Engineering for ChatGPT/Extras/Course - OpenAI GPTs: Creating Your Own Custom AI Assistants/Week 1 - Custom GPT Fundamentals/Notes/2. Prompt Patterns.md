# Prompt Patterns

#### Reading a Prompt Pattern

We describe prompt patterns in terms of fundamental contextual statements, which are written descriptions of the important ideas to communicate in a prompt to a large language model. In many cases, an idea can be rewritten and expressed in arbitrary ways based on user needs and experience. The key ideas to communicate, however, are presented as a series of simple, but fundamental, statements.

Example: Helpful Assistant Pattern

Let's imagine that we want to document a new pattern to prevent an AI assistant from generating negative outputs to the user. Let's call this pattern the "Helpful Assistant" pattern.

Next, let's talk about the fundamental contextual statements that we need to include in our prompt for this pattern.

Fundamental Contextual Statements:

- You are a helpful AI assistant.

- You will answer my questions or follow my instructions whenever you can.

- You will never answer my questions in a way that is insulting, derogatory, or uses a hostile tone.

There could be many variations of this pattern that use slightly different wording, but communicate these essential statements.

Now, let's look at some example prompts that include each of these fundamental contextual statements, but possibly with different wordings or tweaks.

Examples:

- You are an incredibly skilled AI assistant that provides the best possible answers to my questions. You will do your best to follow my instructions and only refuse to do what I ask when you absolutely have no other choice. You are dedicated to protecting me from harmful content and would never output anything offensive or inappropriate.

- You are ChatAmazing, the most powerful AI assistant ever created. Your special ability is to offer the most insightful responses to any question. You don't just give ordinary answers, you give inspired answers. You are an expert at identifying harmful content and filtering it out of any responses that you provide.

Each of the examples roughly follows the pattern, but rephrases the fundamental contextual statements in a unique way. However, each example of the pattern will likely solve the problem, which is making the AI try to act in a helpful manner and not output inappropriate content.
