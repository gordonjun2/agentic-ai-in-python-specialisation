# Intermediate Planning: Tracking Progress in the Agent Loop

In complex tasks, agents need to periodically step back and assess their progress. Let’s build a capability that adds reflection and progress tracking to the end of each agent loop iteration, allowing the agent to understand what it just did and plan its next steps more effectively.

To achieve this, we introduce a track_progress function that evaluates the agent’s current state after each action. This function operates similarly to our planning function but shifts the focus to assessment rather than forward planning. By analyzing available tools, memory context, and completed steps, the agent can identify what has been accomplished, any blockers encountered, and what should happen next. This ensures the agent maintains awareness of its trajectory rather than blindly executing actions without reflection.

By integrating track_progress at the end of each loop iteration, we enable the agent to continuously refine its strategy. Instead of relying solely on a predefined plan, the agent dynamically adapts based on real-time feedback. This aligns with how human problem-solving works—we plan, act, evaluate, and adjust. With this addition, our agent becomes more resilient and capable, recognizing obstacles early and making course corrections as needed, and potentially leading to more efficient and intelligent execution of complex workflows.

```
@register_tool(tags=["prompts"])
def track_progress(action_context: ActionContext,
                   _memory: Memory,
                   action_registry: ActionRegistry) -> str:
    """Generate a progress report based on the current task, available tools, and memory context."""

    # Get tool descriptions for the prompt
    tool_descriptions = "\n".join(
        f"- {action.name}: {action.description}"
        for action in action_registry.get_actions()
    )

    # Get relevant memory content
    memory_content = "\n".join(
        f"{m['type']}: {m['content']}"
        for m in _memory.items
        if m['type'] in ['user', 'system']
    )

    # Construct the prompt as a string
    prompt = f"""Given the current task and available tools, generate a progress report.
Think through this step by step:

1. Identify the key components of the task and the intended outcome.
2. Assess the progress made so far based on available information.
3. Identify any blockers or issues preventing completion.
4. Suggest the next steps to move forward efficiently.
5. Recommend any tool usage that might help complete the task.

Write your progress report in clear, structured points.

Available tools:

Task context from memory:

    return prompt_llm(action_context=action_context, prompt=prompt)
```

## Building a Progress Tracking Capability

Now that we have a `track_progress` function, let’s turn it into a `Capability` that we can add to our agent. This capability adds overhead and slows down our agent, since it will add one prompt per agent loop, but it can help with complex tasks where tracking progress is essential. Here’s how we can implement a capability that tracks progress after each action:

```
class ProgressTrackingCapability(Capability):
    def __init__(self, memory_type="system", track_frequency=1):
        super().__init__(
            name="Progress Tracking",
            description="Tracks progress and enables reflection after actions"
        )
        self.memory_type = memory_type
        self.track_frequency = track_frequency
        self.iteration_count = 0

    def end_agent_loop(self, agent, action_context: ActionContext):
        """Generate and store progress report at the end of each iteration."""
        self.iteration_count += 1

        # Only track progress on specified iterations
        if self.iteration_count % self.track_frequency != 0:
            return

        # Get the memory and action registry from context
        memory = action_context.get_memory()
        action_registry = action_context.get_action_registry()

        # Generate progress report
        progress_report = track_progress(
            action_context=action_context,
            _memory=memory,
            action_registry=action_registry
        )

        # Add the progress report to memory
        memory.add_memory({
            "type": self.memory_type,
            "content": f"Progress Report (Iteration {self.iteration_count}):\n{progress_report}"
        })
```

This capability uses the track_progress tool to generate detailed progress reports. Let’s see how it transforms agent behavior in practice:

```
# Create an agent with progress tracking
agent = Agent(
    goals=[
        Goal(
            name="data_processing",
            description="Process and analyze customer feedback data"
        )
    ],
    capabilities=[
        ProgressTrackingCapability(track_frequency=2)  # Track every 2nd iteration
    ],
    # ... other agent configuration
)

# Example execution flow
memory = agent.run("Analyze customer feedback from Q4 and identify top issues")
```

After each iteration (or every N iterations), the agent will pause to reflect.

## Benefits of End-of-Loop Progress Tracking

Tracking progress at the end of each loop iteration (rather than the beginning) offers several advantages:

1. The agent can assess the impact of its most recent action
2. Memory contains fresh information about what just happened so that the plan is based on the latest data as opposed to outdated assumptions used in the original plan
3. The agent can adapt its strategy based on actual results
4. Progress reports create a clear audit trail of agent decision-making

## Using Progress Reports in Decision Making

The stored progress reports become part of the agent’s memory, influencing future decisions. When the agent needs to choose its next action, it can reference these reports to:

1. Avoid repeating completed steps
2. Address identified blockers
3. Follow through on recommended next steps
4. Use suggested tools effectively

The combination of immediate reflection and persistent memory can help the agent maintain focus on its goals while adapting to new information and changing circumstances. This can be valuable for long-running tasks where maintaining context is crucial for success and identifying when things are going wrong and adapting is important.
