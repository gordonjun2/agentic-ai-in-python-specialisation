# Ahead of Time Planning for Improving Agent Reasoning

One key to making agents more effective is getting them to think strategically before taking action. Instead of jumping straight into executing tools, we want our agent to first develop a comprehensive plan. Let’s build a capability that enforces this “plan first” approach.

## The Plan First Pattern

Here’s how we’ll make our agent plan before acting:

1. When the agent first starts, we’ll prompt it to create a detailed plan
2. We’ll store this plan in the agent’s memory
3. The agent will refer back to this plan throughout its execution

Let’s implement this using a capability:

```
class PlanFirstCapability(Capability):
    def __init__(self, plan_memory_type="system", track_progress=False):
        super().__init__(
            name="Plan First Capability",
            description="The Agent will always create a plan and add it to memory"
        )
        self.plan_memory_type = plan_memory_type
        self.first_call = True
        self.track_progress = track_progress

    def init(self, agent, action_context):
        if self.first_call:
            self.first_call = False
            plan = create_plan(
                action_context=action_context,
                memory=action_context.get_memory(),
                action_registry=action_context.get_action_registry()
            )

            action_context.get_memory().add_memory({
                "type": self.plan_memory_type,
                "content": "You must follow these instructions carefully to complete the task:\n" + plan
            })
```

The key is in our create_plan function, which guides the LLM through structured thinking:

```
@register_tool(tags=["planning"])
def create_plan(action_context: ActionContext,
                memory: Memory,
                action_registry: ActionRegistry) -> str:
   """Create a detailed execution plan based on the task and available tools."""

   # Get tool descriptions for the prompt
   tool_descriptions = "\n".join(
      f"- {action.name}: {action.description}"
      for action in action_registry.get_actions()
   )

   # Get relevant memory content
   memory_content = "\n".join(
      f"{m['type']}: {m['content']}"
      for m in _memory.items
      if m['type'] in ['user', 'system']
   )

   # Construct the prompt as a string
   prompt = f"""Given the task in memory and the available tools, create a detailed plan.
Think through this step by step:

1. First, identify the key components of the task
2. Consider what tools you have available
3. Break down the task into logical steps
4. For each step, specify:
   - What needs to be done
   - What tool(s) will be used
   - What information is needed
   - What the expected outcome is

Write your plan in clear, numbered steps. Each step should be specific and actionable.

Available tools:
{tool_descriptions}

Task context from memory:
{memory_content}

Create a plan that accomplishes this task effectively."""

   return prompt_llm(action_context=action_context, prompt=prompt)
```

The goal is to get the agent to create and include a plan for its work at the start of the conversation. For example, for a data analysis task, the agent might generate a plan like this:

```
# With planning
agent_response = """Plan for Sales Data Analysis:

1. Data Validation
   - Tool: validate_data()
   - Check data completeness and format
   - Ensure all required fields are present
   - Expected: Confirmation of valid dataset

2. Initial Analysis
   - Tool: analyze_data()
   - Calculate key metrics (revenue, growth)
   - Generate summary statistics
   - Expected: Basic statistical overview

3. Trend Identification
   - Tool: find_patterns()
   - Look for seasonal patterns
   - Identify sales trends
   - Expected: List of significant trends

4. Visualization
   - Tool: create_visualization()
   - Create relevant charts
   - Highlight key findings
   - Expected: Clear visual representations

5. Report Generation
   - Tool: generate_report()
   - Compile findings
   - Include visualizations
   - Expected: Comprehensive report

I'll begin with step 1: Data Validation..."""
```

This enhanced version:

1. Creates a detailed plan upfront
2. Stores the plan in memory
3. Helps maintain focus on the overall strategy

Usage:

```
agent = Agent(
    goals=[
        Goal(name="analysis",
             description="Analyze sales data and create a report")
    ],
    capabilities=[
        PlanFirstCapability(track_progress=True)
    ],
    # ... other agent configuration
)

result = agent.run("Analyze our Q4 sales data and create a report")
```
