# Using Human Policies for Document-as-Implementation

In the last lesson, we did something new. We had the agent read some human knowledge at startup to understand what to do. This seemingly simple pattern - loading a purchasing policy from disk and letting the AI interpret it - represents a significant paradigm shift in how we build intelligent systems.

## From Hardcoded Logic to Document-as-Implementation

Traditionally, even in AI systems, business logic follows a familiar pattern: developers analyze requirements, understand policies, and then translate them into code. This creates several fundamental challenges:

1. **Translation Loss**: Each time human knowledge moves from one format to another (from policy document → to developer understanding → to code implementation), some context and nuance is inevitably lost.

2. **Maintenance Challenges**: When policies change, a document gets updated, but the code implementing those policies remains unchanged until a developer manually updates it.

3. **Knowledge Silos**: Only developers can modify the system’s behavior, creating bottlenecks and dependencies.

4. **Validation Difficulties**: It becomes hard to verify if the code accurately implements the current policies.

## The Document-as-Implementation Pattern

Let’s examine what we did in the invoice processing example:

```
# Load the latest purchasing rules from disk
rules_path = "config/purchasing_rules.txt"

try:
    with open(rules_path, "r") as f:
        purchasing_rules = f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    purchasing_rules = "No rules available. Assume all invoices are compliant."
```

This simple file-loading operation represents a profound shift in how we implement business logic:

### Key Benefits

1. **Direct Use of Human Knowledge**

   Instead of translating policies into code, we’re using the human-readable document directly as the implementation. The document itself becomes the logic.

2. **Dynamic Updates Without Code Changes**

   When a policy changes, simply update the document. The system automatically incorporates the latest rules on the next run without requiring developer intervention or redeployment.

3. **Organizational Alignment**

   This pattern aligns with how organizations naturally work. The people responsible for defining policies (legal, compliance, finance) can directly maintain the documents that drive system behavior.

4. **Traceability and Transparency**

   When the agent makes a decision, it’s clear which document version it used. This creates an auditable trail that connects decisions to the exact policies in effect at that time.

## Beyond Basic File Loading

This pattern can be extended far beyond simple text files:

**Knowledge Bases and Wikis**

Agents can pull from entire knowledge bases, internal wikis, or document management systems, allowing them to reason over vast organizational knowledge.

**Versioned Documents**

By using versioned documents, you can trace exactly which version of a policy was applied for any decision, critical for compliance and auditing.

**Multi-Document Reasoning**

Agents can reason across multiple documents, reconciling information from different sources just as a human expert would.

**Document-Guided Workflows**

Process documentation can drive entire workflows, with the agent determining next steps based on standard operating procedures.

## Real-World Applications

This pattern is powerful across many domains:

**Compliance Systems**

Financial institutions can keep regulatory compliance documents as the source of truth, ensuring AI systems always follow current regulations.

**Healthcare Protocols**

Medical systems can reason directly from clinical guidelines and hospital protocols, adapting immediately when best practices are updated.

**HR Policy Enforcement**

HR systems can evaluate requests against the actual policy documents that human resources maintains.

**Customer Service**

Support systems can use product documentation, FAQs, and policy documents to provide consistent, accurate responses.

## Implementing This Pattern

To implement this pattern effectively:

1. **Identify human-readable documents** that contain decision-making knowledge in your organization

2. **Treat these documents as interfaces** between human experts and AI systems

3. **Create loading mechanisms** that pull current document versions at runtime

4. **Design prompts** that effectively frame the document content for the LLM to reason over

5. **Structure outputs** to capture decisions in formats that downstream systems can process

## Conclusion

The document-as-implementation pattern fundamentally changes our approach to building intelligent systems. Instead of translating human knowledge into code, we allow AI to work directly with the documents humans create and maintain.

This creates a more maintainable, transparent system where:

- Domain experts can directly influence system behavior
- Changes in policy immediately affect system decisions
- The gap between documentation and implementation disappears
- Organizations can leverage their existing knowledge artifacts
